"Ode to the Gentleman's Game"
Beneath the sun’s relentless blaze,
On verdant fields where willows graze,
Eleven men in white convene,
To wage a war so calm, serene.

With padded guards and polished shoes,
A bowler strides, the fielders muse.
His fingers grip the stitched red seam—
He hurls not hate, but skill and dream.

The batsman stands, both calm and tight,
His eye on leather, stance just right.
A whir, a thud, a mighty crack—
The ball takes flight, the crowd leans back.

Through dusty streets or gilded green,
From gullies small to Lords’ grand scene,
This game unites both young and old—
In monsoon rain or heatwave bold.

The toss—a coin, a choice, a fate.
Will bat or bowl decide our state?
Will dew descend on twilight’s lawn,
Or chase the runs at early dawn?

Spinners tease with loops and flight,
Like cobras dancing in the night.
Fast bowlers thunder down with pace,
Like storms that make the brave give chase.

The umpire stands with stoic grace,
No flinch upon his weathered face.
A finger raised, the silence breaks,
The batter walks, no room for fakes.

Then comes the lunch, the tales are spun,
Of overs past and battles won.
Of wickets taken, catches dropped,
And fearless runs when time had stopped.

Oh, cricket! More than sport or game,
You set our souls and hearts aflame.
In tests that stretch for five full days,
You still enthrall in subtle ways.

You birthed great names in history's page—
Gavaskar’s calm, Lara’s rage.
The swing of Wasim, Sachin’s flair,
The roar of Stokes, Dhoni’s stare.

From Eden’s roar to MCG,
From Karachi to Kolkata’s spree,
You’ve built your shrines in every land—
With tape-wrapped balls and dusty sand.

You teach us more than bat and ball:
To rise again each time we fall.
To wait, to learn, to plan, to strive—
To play with heart, to feel alive.
